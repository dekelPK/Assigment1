                Discovering Blackberries: Unveiling Nature's Sweet Secrets :
            </h2>
            <p>
                The blackberry is defined in the world as a deciduous shrub, meaning that it falls in the winter
                (depending
                on the temperature), with fruit growth in the shape of a dark purple spherical grape.

                The blueberry is known in English as Blueberry and most of us know the fruit itself and know what it
                looks
                like. However, most Israelis have not seen the blackberry bush and seen how it grows on the tree.

                It is particularly strange to observe such a discourse that is not familiar from everyday life and
                cultural
                representations in Israel. Blueberries grow in small clusters on the reddish branches.

                There is a dispute with kashrut bodies in Israel as to whether it is a tree or a bush.

                In the world, blueberries are grown in a cultured culture, so they are common throughout the year.

                The fruits can be stored for a relatively short period of up to 10 days in a cool and dry place. You can
                freeze them for a longer period of time without damaging their qualities.

                The growth of berries in Israel took off following the sharp increase in the demand for these fruits in
                the
                world in Israel in particular. Conscious consumers have increased the demand for healthy fruits, which
                are
                considered a superfood.

                Among the berries, blueberries stand out as a particularly healthy superfood. Even in the unrestrained
                culinary world, the use of chefs' and confectioners' menus has expanded.

            <h2>
                5 health benefits of blueberries :
            </h2>
            <p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Reduce the chance of heart disease -
                    <br>
                    From a study published in 2019 in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, it appears that
                    consuming
                    blueberries daily can reduce the risk of heart disease and even improve the condition of patients.
                    The
                    researchers tested the effect of eating blueberries on about 140 participants, who suffer from
                    excess
                    weight and metabolic syndrome (a collection of risk factors that predict heart disease and diabetes
                    -
                    such as hypertension, cholesterol and blood sugar). They found that eating a cup of blueberries a
                    day
                    (about 150 grams), for at least six months - can significantly improve blood vessel function and
                    reduce
                    the risk of heart disease by 12-15 percent. Although this is a small study, funded by agricultural
                    associations - but the results show that blueberries definitely have quite a bit of health
                    potential.
                </li>
                <li>. High nutritional value and low caloric value -
                    <br>
                    Blueberries are rich in vitamins, minerals, dietary fiber and antioxidants - and all this with a
                    relatively low caloric value, making them an excellent snack for people who are watching their
                    weight.
                    Blueberries contain, among other things, potassium, quite a bit of vitamin K, vitamin C and folic
                    acid -
                    and only 85 calories.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Balance the cholesterol in the blood -
                    <br>
                    Blueberries can reduce LDL cholesterol levels - the "bad cholesterol" that can lead to artery
                    clogging
                    and cardiovascular disease. Blueberries contain phytosterols, compounds previously found to be able
                    to
                    reduce LDL cholesterol levels in healthy adults by 8-10 percent.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Rich in antioxidants -
                    <br>
                    Antioxidants are important for preventing chronic diseases, as well as contributing to reducing DNA
                    damage and thus preventing accelerated aging of the body's cells. They are especially rich in the
                    antioxidant anthocyanin, a pigment that can reduce the risk of cancer and chronic diseases. They
                    also
                    contain pterostilbene, another antioxidant found to be able to prevent breast cancer and heart
                    disease.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Good for the digestive system -
                    <br>
                    Blueberries have prebiotic components, which can improve the function of the digestive system and
                    prevent intestinal diseases. Prebiotics are actually the food of the probiotic bacteria, that is,
                    the
                    friendly bacteria in our digestive system that are important, among other things, for the effective
                    absorption of nutrients, including vitamins and minerals. In addition to this, since prebiotics are
                    food
                    for the friendly bacteria, they contribute to the balance of the bacteria in the digestive system
                    and
                    thus prevent an increase in the amount of "bad" bacteria that can lead to the development of various
                    diseases in the digestive system.
